# FlashCards

## Summary
FlashCards is the first project of Module 2 at the Turing School of Software & Design. FlashCards is a game that simulates the display of set of flashcards, allows the user to select an answer for each question and provides feedback based on the accuracy of that answer. This game is built to run exclusively in the command line interface. This project requires the implementation of a robust testing suite, emphasizing test driven development and promoting the desing of modular, reusable code. FlashCards also introduces object oriented design as well as implementation of ES6 classes.
