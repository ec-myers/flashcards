# FlashCards

## Summary
FlashCards is the first project of Module 2 at the Turing School of Software & Design. FlashCards is a game that simulates the display of a set of 30 flashcards aimed at testing the users knowledge of object and array prototype methods. It also allows the user to select an answer for each question and provides feedback based on the accuracy of that answer. This game is built to run exclusively in the command line interface (CLI). 

This project requires the implementation of a robust testing suite, emphasizing test driven development and promoting the desing of modular, reusable code. FlashCards also introduces object oriented design as well as implementation of ES6 classes.
